# DECT-ULE

DECT ULTRA LOW ENERGY is a DECT based standaard for wireless networking. Equipment vendors like Gigaset (Siemens) and [Fritz!DECT](https://avm.de/produkte/fritzdect/)(AVM) and Telekom provide sensors, switches, thermostats, buttons and radiator valves.

Companies like [Dialog Semiconductors](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/dect) (now Renesas) provide ULE modules that can be integrated into these systems. However, Gigaset is a closed system.
