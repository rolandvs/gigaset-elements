# Gigaset Elements
Dissecting the hard- and software of the [Gigaset Elements]()

# Intro
This repo is about the Gigaset Elements system. A pretty good alarm/home automation system based on DECT for communication.

As with all commercial Home Automation Systems the problems start when you want to add something that is not in the catalog list. 

# Tear Down
To learn often means take it apart, check it out and reassembly. Some products are a joy to take apart as they are engineered beautifully. In case of the Elements the modules are very nicely build together with great detail. For the dissecting I use some regular tool, like a Philips screw driver, something alike a plectrum and some toolset available through [iFixit](https://www.ifxit.com).

# Gigaset Smart Plug Tear Down
The main reason to do a tear down of this plug is to check out if it can be used for other things than simple on/off.

![Remove the top]() by taking away the sticker covering the anti-theft screw `CR-V 3` bit of iFixit's Macro Bit Set. This way the top can be removed by using a plectrum of sorts at [these]() and at the opposite site [these]() locks. The top side can be removed.
Next is to [unscrew]() the two screws that hold the pins of the plug at the other end. The bottom part can be removed also leaving only the PCB's.
