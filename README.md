# Gigaset Elements
Dissecting the hard- and software of the [Gigaset Elements](https://www.gigaset.com/hq_en/cms/smart-home-overview.html)

# Intro
This repo is about the Gigaset Elements system. A pretty good alarm/home automation system based on [DECT](https://www.dect.org) for communication.

As with all commercial Home Automation Systems: the problems start when you want to add something that is not in the catalog list. 

# Tear Down
To learn about it often means: take it apart, check it out and reassembly. Some products are a joy to take apart as they are engineered beautifully. In case of the Elements modules: they are very nicely engineered with great detail. For the tear down I use a regular tool, like a Phillips screw driver, something like a plectrum and bit from bit set of [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com).
