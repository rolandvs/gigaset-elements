# Gigaset Smart Plug Tear Down
The main reason to do a tear down of this plug is to check out if it can be used for other things than simple on/off. The description is without visible pictures. However, click on the links for a detailed picture.

[Remove the top](pictures/plug_top.jpeg) by taking away the sticker covering the anti-theft screw `CR-V 3` bit of iFixit's Macro Bit Set. This way the top can be removed by using a plectrum of sorts at [these](pictures/plug_front.jpeg) and at the opposite site [these](pictures/plug_back.jpeg) locks. The top side can be removed. Next is to [unscrew](pictures/plug_pin1.jpeg) the two screws that hold the pins of the plug at the other end. The bottom [part](pictures/plug_pin2.jpeg) can be removed also leaving only the PCB's.
